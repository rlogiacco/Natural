> Please, before submitting a support request read carefully this README and check if an answer already exists among [previously answered questions](https://github.com/rlogiacco/Natural/discussions): do not abuse of the Github issue tracker.

### &#x26A0; **WARNING**

The fact this project is open source **does not** mean you are entitled to contact me on my personal email address nor implies I'm willing to work for you for free: if you have a problem which is not addressed by this plugin either you wait until the fix comes in or you fix it yourself and, if you wish so, submit a pull request.
If you don't have the knowledge or the time to fix your issue you can always hire someone to do it for you. In any case, **do not** submit requests or issues to my personal email address.

### You heard me, don't force my hand on this.

# IMPORTANT UPDATE

After many years an awesome developer has finally decided to step up and share the burden of bringing this plugin to its next stages: thanks **[Aaron R. Miller](https://github.com/drkstr101)** for your contributions, but above all, thanks for your enthusiasm and for reinvigorating the project!

This doesn't mean we wouldn't appreciate your help so don't be shy and submit your contributions! If you are unable or unwilling to contribute your time, please consider a donation: we have opened a [Github Sponsors account][5].
